These statements are not contradictory. For example, if you are adding the result of 3 functions in a

func1() and func2() if it is left associative. However, whether you calculate func1 or func2 first
is up to the compiler.

+ 1 * 2 3 4
could be 1 + (2*3) + 4 or 1 + (2*3*4)

Fixed: Issues of precedence and associativity do not occur with prefix or postfix notation when
the operator is confined to a strict number of operands
